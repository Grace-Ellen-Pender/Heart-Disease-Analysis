## Project Directories
- `Notebooks` → R markdown and Jupyter Notebook files
- `Data` → data used for the analyses   
- `Outputs` → rendered reports

## Project Description
The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset contains patient information (age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.) and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.
Dataset source: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)

This project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Visualisation of key variables  
- Statistical testing for associations with heart disease
-  Machine learning model training for predictive analysis

## View Reports

You can view the rendered HTML outputs directly in your browser:

- [Machine Learning Report](https://grace-ellen-pender.github.io/Heart-Disease-Analysis/Outputs/Machine_Learning_Heart_Disease.html)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Grace-Ellen-Pender/Heart-Disease-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the .Rmd file in RStudio (for the statistical analysis) or the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook (for the machine learning pipeline).

3. Install required packages (listed in the code, e.g., tidyverse, ggplot2, scikit-learn, pandas).

4. Place the dataset in the same folder as the code files if not already present.

5. Run all cells/chunks to reproduce the analysis.
